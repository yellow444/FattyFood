					<h3>Black lists</h3>
					<p>Blacklists apply to comments (words, user names and IP addresses), registration of members (user names and IP addresses), and the "contact" (words, user names and IP addresses).</p>
					<p class="last">Each term is added case insensitive, and the accents do not matter. For example the word "present" will banish the words "present", "Present", "PRESENT", etc.. You can also use the character * as a wildcard, which will find any string of characters.</p>
